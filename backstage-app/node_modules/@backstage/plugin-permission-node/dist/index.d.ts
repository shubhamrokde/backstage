 * To make this concrete, we can use the Backstage software catalog as an
 * example. The catalog has conditional rules around access to specific
 * _entities_ in the catalog. The _type_ of resource is captured here as
 * `resourceType`, a string identifier (`catalog-entity` in this example) that
 * can be provided with permission definitions. This is merely a _type_ to
 * verify that conditions in an authorization policy are constructed correctly,
 * not a reference to a specific resource.
 *
 * The `rules` parameter is an array of {@link PermissionRule}s that introduce
 * conditional filtering logic for resources; for the catalog, these are things
 * like `isEntityOwner` or `hasAnnotation`. Rules describe how to filter a list
 * of resources, and the `conditions` returned allow these rules to be applied
 * with specific parameters (such as 'group:default/team-a', or
 * 'backstage.io/edit-url').
 *
 * The `getResources` argument should load resources based on a reference
 * identifier. For the catalog, this is an
 * {@link @backstage/catalog-model#EntityRef}. For other plugins, this can be
 * any serialized format. This is used to construct the
 * `createPermissionIntegrationRouter`, a function to add an authorization route
 * to your backend plugin. This function will be called by the
 * `permission-backend` when authorization conditions relating to this plugin
 * need to be evaluated.
